# Quiz 4 - we came; we built; we interacted

This is the last `quiz`... you've made it through:

- Quiz 1: `setup and soundbeats`
	- do you remember your first template clone into robots?
  - what about your reaction to `how do I make an emotion with code`? 
  - or changing `just one thing`?

- Quiz 2: `classy robot family`
	- do you know where your `classy` children are?
	- what about their parents? 
	- do you remember how similar `OOP` is when we looked at `processing.py` vs `p5.js`?

- Quiz 3: `message in a bottle`
  - you are no longer limited to `one file - one location`!
  - smile! There will be a surprize sent to your `GPS` next week!
  - interacting digitally across space and time (in just a few lines..)

## Let's look back

Our notes from last class (_THE_ [`last class`](last-class.md)) might be helpful to reference while answering the `Quiz 4` questions.

Here we go! Just answer in this `readme.md` file - you can even do it online, remember? (grab a copy of the repo first though!).

### Week 01

1. setup
   - What is a repo and why do we use them?
   repo is a repository on github.
   github repo is hosting service, repo has a lot of features like control, access and collaborate. Is good for student.
2. version control
   - Why do we use version control? How did you manage making use of this? Be specific.
   version control can do some things to code.like records,tracking, manage and undate......
   Allows us to simply use the code, and record all this, such as modifying the code.
   When my code doesn't work, I revert back to the previous version I modified. That way I'll see if there are any errors with my latest revision.
3. processing
   - Why is processing similar across _at least_ three languages (Java, Python, JavaScript)? What might be the point of this?
  Java, Python, JavaScript is Object-oriented programming languages.they are the dominant language because thet are so effectiveness, reusability, modularity and flexbility.They can be used separately, eg each language can have different tasks in same project.

### Week 02

1. IDEs
   - What IDEs did you use over the last 3.5 months?
   Eclipse IDE
2. UI & UI Elements
   - Give me a specific example of where you considered UI in any of your course content submissions?
   I make the ui on browser extention in lab01
3. JSON
   - What _exactly_ is JSON? Decide how you want to answer this.
   Json is JavaScript Object Notation that is foramt ,  I remember I use API in the lab so i need use json. help me transmitting data.
4. CLI & GUI
   - Give me at least 3 ways we used GitHub and explain the difference between local and remote copies of a repo.
   Git hub desktop ,Github GUI and Github command line input.
   local cpoies ni the hard drives like your comupter remote copies are save in the remote rervers like github.
5. debug
   - What magical number-letter combo helps us debug in the browser? (What is a cross-origin error?) How can I display console content?
   F12
   this error is restricition that is like brower applies loading some resources from some other web sites.
---

### Week 03

1. Browsers, extensions
   - Interaction with the browser through extensions required at least 2 things. Tell me what you think they are. There is a correct answer, and I talked about it in a January video.
.............
2. DOM, selectors, elements
   - How are these related? 
   DOM is Document Object Model.
   selectors define the elements to which a set of CSS rules apply.
   elements is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag.
3. JavaScript OOP
   - Show me 2 specific ways you used an OOP style in your course content submissions. Where did I use OOP in my p5.js updates?
   Like the quiz2 child robot, child baby robot and parents robot.....
---

### Week 04

1. Python
   - Show me where you completed the `try these` instructions from [Feb 3](https://github.com/robots-make-art-too/EECS_1720/tree/main/General-Content/Content_by_Week/Week04/Week04-live_code)
   Click to change color
2. Describe and list common attributes of any object-oriented programming language.
   encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism
---

### Week 05

1. Python OOP
   - Write a python class for a `classy robot` that has the following: a name, an age, and can start and stop dancing when you clap. You can do it in under 10 lines (it can be pseudo-code like).
   class classy_robot():
      name="hello"
      age=4

   def start_dance(isclap):   
      if (isclap):
       print("dance")
      else:
       print("no dance")
   
2. APIs
   - What API did you connect with in Lab 2? Briefly explain how you integrated interactivity within your code. 
     tweepy-twitter API
     use consumer key to verify my identity
---

### Week 06

1. server-client
   - Give me an example of an interaction done `client-side` and an interaction done `server-side`.
   client-side like use html css js ,"front" part
   server-side like java python, the back-end part
2. local hosting
   - what is the difference between dragging an index.html file into your browser and opening an index.html file using localhost? Do you remember the number equivalent to localhost? 
   when you dragging your index.html into browser, some js scripts can't loading
   127.0.0.1
---

### Week 07

1. GitHub pages
   - What is a `deployment` in this context? What is a branch and why are they used for contributing to repos? 
   The place to run the code is different, and the Purposes are also different
   help the local webpages deply to the github servers. 
   branch can help each person can be responsible for a part of the code, and then combine them together.
2. Augmented Reality
   - What makes AR possible? What is needed in a code context?
    have a camera
    We can add the AR libraries. like opencv, a-frame and intergrate camera components etc...
---

### Week 08

1. aesthetics
   - Give me a specific example of where you considered aesthetic design in any of your course content?
   I think my browser plug-in is good design, simple UI like google, easy for users to understand
2. APIs for extending integration
   - Identify where in _your_ code, for Quiz 1, Quiz 2, Quiz 3, Lab 1, Lab 2, Lab 3 that either you used an API or where you _could_ integrate an API (it could be that we added API access in the lecture example and you used the same - still identify this).
  Lab02, quiz2 and quiz3 use API
---

### Week 09

1. OOP elements & interactive JavaScript
   - How did we interact with webpage elements using code?
    we can use document.getElementById() to control element.

2. integrating multi-code & external content
   - What kind of event-based interactions are possible in web-based applications? 
 like key pressed, key released, mouse click, dragging, touch.etc
---

### Week 10

1. Levels of location - local to geo
   - How did we instantiate multiple geo-locations and dynamic object loading in our AR code?
   we can use the object that is place in js file to make mutiple geo location. and we  use renferplace to load the object in the AR code.
2. app hosting
   - What is important about constructing an app? How does this relate to its `environment`?
  I think Learning to code, Supported Platforms, Future proofing, Accepting payments, Database.etc
  you can choosing your hosting environment, make more ez.

---

### Week 11

1. interaction along the virtuality-reality continuum
   - Why are `id`'s important for interaction?
   Personal features, Psychological features.
2. Tell me about 2 WEB-APIs and how you could integrate them into any of your course content submissions? Give me a line or two of code.
      API.search_tweets()
      Standard search API
---

### Week 12

1. tracking
   - Briefly describe how the complexity changes between image, facial, and hand, tracking? 
   image>facial>hand. from easy to hard.
2. OOP, ECS, DOM
   - What are these acronyms? How are they related?
   OOP-Object-oriented programming
   ECS-Entity-Component-System
   DOM-Document Object Model
   I think OOP for server or app and help DOM(object)(inheritance), ECS is not so care about inheritance,Dom is all object.
   The three focus are different.
3. How do you register a component in A-Frame, and show me how to relate this component to data flow, API, and useage. 
     AFRAME.registerComponent('hello-world', {
  init: function () {
    console.log('Hello, World!');
  }
});
     
     AFRAME.registerComponent('log', {

    speed: {type: 'number'}
  }
});
