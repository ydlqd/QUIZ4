# Last Class!! 

This is the end of EECS 1720 - Building Interactive Systems! We have done so much and come so far! 

## Big Picture

A second course teaching more advanced programming concepts within the context of image, sound and interaction using an object-oriented language; introduction to interactive systems, user interfaces, event-driven programming, object design and inheritance; implementation using debuggers, integrated development environments, user interface builders. 

Winter 2022: Augmented Reality Class Exhibit.

### Building

1. To form by combining materials or parts; construct.
2. To form by ordering and uniting materials by gradual means into a composite whole
3. To develop or give form to according to a plan or process; create.
4. To develop according to a systematic plan, by a definite process, or on a particular base

### Interactive

1. involving the actions or input of a user especially : of, relating to, or being a two-way electronic communication system (such as a telephone, cable television, or a computer) that involves a user's orders (as for information or merchandise) or responses (as to a poll) 
2. to act upon one another
3. Interactivity is the communication process that takes place between humans and computer software.

### Systems

1. A group of interacting, interrelated, or interdependent elements forming a complex whole, especially.
2. An organism as a whole, especially with regard to its vital processes or functions.
3. collection of elements or components that are organized for a common purpose.
4. the organization or plan itself (and is similar in meaning to method, as in "I have my own little system") and sometimes describes the parts in the system (as in "computer system")

## Topics

1. User Interfaces (UIs), UI Elements, Guidelines for UI design
2. User Interface Builders, Integrated Development Environments
3. Objects, classes and inheritance
4. Interactive WWW -based systems - basic network concepts, guidelines for design
5. Event driven programming
6. Intro to threads and/or asynchronous event handling
7. Designing engaging interactive systems, games, etc.
8. IFTTT concepts and bootstrapping
9. basic server-client models, browser extensions, Web APIs
10. real-time networking

## Extensions

An extension adds features and functions to a browser. It's created using familiar web-based technologies—HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It can take advantage of the same web APIs as JavaScript on a web page, but an extension also has access to its own set of JavaScript APIs. This means that you can do a lot more in an extension than you can with code in a web page. 

1. The act of extending or the condition of being extended

- Enhance or complement a website
- Let people show their personality
- Add or remove content from web pages:
- Add tools and new browsing features
- Games
- Add development tools

## APIs

Application programming interfaces, or APIs, simplify software development and innovation by enabling applications to exchange data and functionality easily and securely.

1. An application programming interface, or API, enables companies to open up their applications’ data and functionality to external third-party developers, business partners, and internal departments within their companies. 
2. This allows services and products to communicate with each other and leverage each other’s data and functionality through a documented interface. 
3. Developers don't need to know how an API is implemented; they simply use the interface to communicate with other products and services. 
4. API use has surged over the past decade, to the degree that many of the most popular web applications today would not be possible without APIs.

## Python

Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small- and large-scale projects.

- Python is powerful... and fast;
- plays well with others;
- runs everywhere;
- is friendly & easy to learn;
- is Open

## JavaScript

JavaScript, often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. Over 97% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries.

JavaScript is a programming language used primarily by Web browsers to create a dynamic and interactive experience for the user. Most of the functions and applications that make the Internet indispensable to modern life are coded in some form of JavaScript!

## XR

XR is a new buzzword in the tech world, but it’s pretty simple to understand. XR is an umbrella term that rolls in VR, AR, and MR. In a nutshell, XR technology is any tech that takes your display and makes it more immersive, or makes it interact with your real-world surroundings in some way. And it truly is changing the future. 

- extended reality: `XR`
  - virtual reality: `VR`
  - augmented reality: `AR`
  - mixed reality: `MR`

For decades, we have attempted to bridge the gap between the digital and physical worlds. XR is a superset which includes the entire spectrum from `the complete real` to `the complete virtual` 
- concept of reality–virtuality continuum  
- lies in the extension of `human experiences` especially relating to the `senses of existence` (represented by VR) and the `acquisition of cognition` (represented by AR)
- Continuous development in human–computer interactions means this concept is still evolving...

### Augmented Reality

Augmented reality is a technique that adds layers to the world as we are used to it. These layers could be visual, auditory and sensory information to intensify your experience.

Even though you can’t change the world you’re living in, augmented reality makes it possible to give your surroundings an extra dimension. By using images, sounds, texts or even GPS data, you can enrich the place you’re in. It is key that these elements are presented spatially to affect your depth perception.

The AR technique has a certain degree of power, convincing your brain that those elements really exist in your environment.

## Learning Objectives

1. CLO1: Conduct meta-design (design a system to design things).
2. CLO2: Integrate computational techniques for content generation (or filtering) in a
social media context. Differentiate and appraise the aesthetic of systems for generating
public performances.
3. CLO3: Differentiate and appraise the aesthetics, design, and concept of systems that
support collaboration and emergent creative behaviour. Implement fundamental data
structures to design an interface, balancing constraints and incentives for participation.
4. CLO4: Review protocols for website structure and display. Identify and creatively
experiment with Internet browser functionality and APIs.
5. CLO5: Apply generative design principles to the design of 3D form. Discuss form in
relation to the contexts of the body, society, or the environment.
6. CLO6: Develop, design, and execute a creative intervention at a specific site.

### Our path

1. something a bit familar
   - processing, IDE
2. similar structure but introduction of Python and JavaScript
3. JSON, CLI, GUI
   - systems for building ... systems !
4. use of OOP in Javascript and Python
   - robots! families so cute! 
   - interaction dynamics with p5js
5. start to build systems that can run..
   - locally
   - hosted
6. how to interact?
   - permissions
   - extensions
7. next step in permissions? APIs
   - tokens, connecting
   - the developers method of interacting between existing systems
8. Building custom access to platforms you know, you use
9. What can we do? What do you want to do? What does Digital Media ask?
   - art, access, content, custom, unique, technical!
   - you need to develop skills to be able to create your own ideas and manifest them!
10. Public content
    - adding extensions, connecting to social platforms, hosting your own content
11. Cross-platform, cross-device - web-based
    - open source! see how to build so that you can build!
12. XR is future, content is immersive, we are just beginning to explore this
13. Can't wait to see the final projects!
